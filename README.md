In this paper we will be examining a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
This data contains information about early stage Parkinson's Disease based on various vocal
and tonal features. Analyses that are done include Linear Regression, Anova Tests, Linear Mixed Effects
Regression, Difference of Deviance, t-tests, as well as some confidence intervals.

We seek to explore the significant tonal features that can accurately predict the Unified Parkinson's Disease
Rating Scale score (UPDRS score) of an individual in an attempt to potentially automate or speed up the diagnosis
process and go straight into treatement and care.
